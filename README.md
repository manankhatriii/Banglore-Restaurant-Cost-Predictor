For this project, I used restaurant data from Bangalore to build a model predicting approximate dining costs. I performed feature engineering by reducing and modifying columns, conducted outlier detection, and applied label encoding. I displayed descriptive and inferential statistics and created various data visualizations to uncover insights. I evaluated eight different regression models for prediction accuracy and fine-tuned them using GridSearchCV. Finally, I developed a Streamlit app where users can input their preferences and receive an approximate cost based on their given parameters.For this project, I used restaurant data from Bangalore to build a model predicting approximate dining costs.
